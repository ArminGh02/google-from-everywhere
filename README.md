## About
This is a very simple script that I use when I want to select some text and google it right away.

## How to Use
Download executable file from **[releases](https://github.com/ArminGh02/google-from-everywhere/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** and run it.
Just select some text in any window and then if you want to google it, press `win + shift + g`,
else if you want to look it up in **[Google Dictionary](www.google.com/search?q=google+dictionary)**, press `win + shift + w`.
It will run your primary browser and google that for you.

## Automatic Startup
To automatically start the script at login, open Run with `win + r` and write `shell:startup`, then copy a shortcut of the file there.
